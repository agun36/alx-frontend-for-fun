## Getting Started

To start using flexbox, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. If you're new to flexbox, it's recommended to go through some tutorials or guides to get familiar with the concepts.

## Flex Container

A flex container is an element that contains flex items. It establishes a new flex formatting context and provides a context for flex items to be laid out.

### Flex Container Properties

- `display`: Specifies the type of container. Use `display: flex` to create a block-level flex container or `display: inline-flex` for an inline-level flex container.
- `flex-direction`: Defines the direction of the main axis. It can be `row`, `row-reverse`, `column`, or `column-reverse`.
- `justify-content`: Aligns flex items along the main axis.
- `align-items`: Aligns flex items along the cross axis.
- `flex-wrap`: Specifies whether flex items should wrap or not when there is not enough space.

## Flex Items

Flex items are the children of a flex container. They can be laid out in any direction and order within the flex container.

### Flex Item Properties

- `order`: Specifies the order of a flex item.
- `flex-grow`: Defines how much a flex item can grow relative to other flex items.
- `flex-shrink`: Defines how much a flex item can shrink relative to other flex items.
- `flex-basis`: Specifies the initial size of a flex item.
- `align-self`: Overrides the `align-items` property for a specific flex item.

## Flexbox Properties

In addition to the flex container and flex item properties, there are other properties that can be used to control the layout and behavior of flexbox.

### Other Flexbox Properties

- `flex`: Shorthand property for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`.
- `align-content`: Aligns flex lines along the cross axis when there is extra space in the flex container.
- `gap`: Specifies the gap between flex items.
